# AWS-C0 truthful first-deployment sequencing correction

This is the bounded local-only correction requested in the existing AUDITOR
task, user turn `01a077f4-71f5-7421-a5c3-c178e8c7c9a1`, delegated to the sole
controller. It permits implementation, local validation, normal local commits
and one narrow independent review. It does not authorize an AWS call, credential
renewal, upload, deployment, instance start, smoke or scientific execution during
this correction. The source user message asks continuation after the reported
blocker; this document does not claim the user typed a future generated packet.

## Minimal change

The existing closure seed required an authenticated workflow observation before
the workflow existed. Both the preparation closure and live packet also required
eleven observed controls before CloudFormation created the workflow and SSM
document. Existing records remain historical and immutable.

Seed-v2 instead binds intended deployment input bytes and fixed coordinates,
explicitly not deployed identity. Launch remains an input-only record, referring
only to already published artifacts and seed versions. The generic template
artifact is not a later resolved-parameter manifest: the latter must never be
substituted into the eight-artifact set or bound by an earlier seed.

Preparation retains six initial observations. Preparation closure and live
packet retain nine observed controls, excluding the two not-yet-created workflow
and SSM document. Their expected bytes are explicit deployment inputs. The
unexecuted change set remains an actual observed input to the later operation.

The exact prior deployment authority is recorded before ExecuteChangeSet.
The live session itself must already have separate valid assumption authority;
the exact deployment statement uses its actual issued expiry and authorizes
ExecuteChangeSet/publication/start only, never the already completed assumption.
Following the one authorized execution and successful stack completion, eleven
authenticated controls are collected. Live-authorization-v6 binds these results,
their producing action, the earlier authority and the intended inputs before
StartExecution. Its later publication does not retroactively authorize execution.
Workflow definition, role, logging and document content/version must agree with
the intended source bytes and real deployment outputs. The Lambda repeats direct
workflow/document checks before the workflow can start the instance.

The postdeployment authorization remains the existing later object, not an extra
pre-live object. The 24/23 counts and exact six V5/V6 historical bytes/kinds remain
unchanged. The explicit transitive version map is in
`aws_c0_deployment_sequence_correction_contract.json`; old schema meanings are
not repurposed. No dummy receipt, predicted VersionId, preliminary foundation
deployment, replay, scientific behavior, new instance or permission broadening
is permitted. The same account, region, retained t3.small and USD50 cap apply.

The correction does not change trust, caller permissions, compact V5 policy,
scientific payload, controller transport arity, SSM command body or ASL behavior.
Any AWS continuation must use fresh actual observations and separately valid
bounded authority; local tests are not deployed readiness.
